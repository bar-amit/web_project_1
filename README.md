#Learn How to Learn

This is a single page wesite with useful information about learning. It was built during a web development course - Practicum by Yandex.

##What Tools Have I Used?

In this project I used plain html and css. The files are structured by the [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/) method.

##Animation

Different elements are animated with the css properties of '[transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)' and '[animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes)' ('@keyframes').
